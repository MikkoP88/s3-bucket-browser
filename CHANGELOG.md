# Changelog

All notable changes to S3 Bucket Browser are documented here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Top menu bar (File / Edit / View / Help): dropdown menus with shortcut
  hints, separators and greyed-out unavailable actions; minimal About
  dialog (version, MIT license, project URL).
- Central command-state system: toolbar buttons now grey out when their
  action is unavailable (no selection, no profile, nothing to paste, …).
- Doctor v2 backend: every check carries start/finish timestamps, checks
  can be run individually by name (`DoctorChecks`, `RunDoctorCheck`),
  policy and ACL are timed separately; hermetic unit tests for the
  registry.
- Doctor v2 dialog: check list rendered before running, "Run all" plus
  per-check re-run, status pills, start→finish times and durations,
  expandable detail (advice, error, raw info JSON).
- Structured in-app log events (`log:line`): transfers, doctor runs,
  batch operations (delete/copy/move/rename/mkdir/storage-class) and
  listing failures emit timestamped, scoped, leveled log lines for the
  upcoming log drawer; no secrets are ever logged.
- Optional bottom log drawer (View menu / Ctrl+L / status-bar "Log"):
  timestamp + level + scope + message per line, level filter, copy,
  clear, auto-scroll toggle, 2000-line ring buffer; hidden by default
  and remembered across sessions.
- Auto refresh: View ▸ Auto refresh with Off / 5 s / 10 s / 30 s / 60 s
  intervals plus a "refresh on focus" option; ticks are skipped while a
  modal or context menu is open, transfers are running, or the window is
  hidden; the interval shows in the status bar and persists. The menu
  bar gained one-level submenus and checkmark items to support this.

### Fixed

- Windows: launching the GUI no longer opens an empty console window behind
  the app. The binary keeps its console subsystem (the CLI needs it), but
  GUI mode now detaches the console at startup (`FreeConsole`), so
  double-click / Start-menu launches are popup-free; CLI behavior and
  launching from a terminal are unchanged.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-09

First stable release. Windows-Explorer-style S3 GUI + CLI in one binary,
MIT-licensed, zero telemetry.

### Added — core browsing & transfer

- Explorer-style GUI: toolbar, back/forward/up history, breadcrumb, folder
  tree sidebar, sortable details grid, status bar, light/dark theme.
- Full multi-select (click / Ctrl / Shift / Ctrl+A, marquee, type-to-jump)
  and a complete keyboard map (F1 in-app).
- Drag & drop: OS files/folders onto the window to upload; rows onto
  folders/tree to move (same bucket) or copy (cross bucket).
- Dual-pane local browser (F9) with cross-pane drag & drop, synchronized
  browsing and one-click directory compare (newer/older/size-diff/only-here).
- Transfer manager: multipart upload/download with per-file and byte-level
  progress, speed, cancel, optional bandwidth throttle.
- Conflict policies (overwrite / skip / rename) on upload and download;
  external-editor integration with automatic re-upload on save.
- CLI with full parity: `ls`, `tree`, `du`, `stat`, `mb`, `rb`, `mkdir`,
  `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `sync`, `presign`, `find`, `sc`, `doctor`, `profile`,
  shell completions (bash/zsh/fish/powershell), `--json` everywhere,
  exit-code contract 0/1/2/3.

### Added — versioning (headline feature)

- Per-object version timeline, restore-as-latest, one-click undo delete for
  delete markers, permanent destroy of specific versions (L3), bulk purge
  of noncurrent versions, version statistics; `rb --force` purges full
  version history of versioned buckets.

### Added — bucket administration

- Tabbed admin panel + `s3b bucket …`: versioning, policy, CORS,
  lifecycle, default encryption, public-access block, static website,
  tags, object-lock configuration.
- Storage-class conversion (server-side self-copy), per-object retention
  (GOVERNANCE/COMPLIANCE) and legal hold, `mb --object-lock`.

### Added — safety, connection & scale

- Safety ladder (PLAN.md §9): count-then-act on every destructive
  operation, `--force` gates, `--dry-run` previews, typed bucket name in
  the GUI for bucket-wide actions.
- Profiles with OS-keyring secret storage (Windows Credential Manager /
  macOS Keychain / Linux SecretService), `0600` file fallback, masked
  secrets in all output, `~/.aws/credentials` import, connectivity test.
- Connection doctor: DNS → TCP → TLS → auth → policy/ACL with
  plain-language remediation; provider capability matrix (R2, MinIO, B2,
  Wasabi, …) warns before unsupported requests fail.
- Streaming listings (the Go side holds one page at a time) and cancelable
  streaming deep search by name, size, age or storage class.
- Favorites, i18n (English + Finnish built in), accessibility pass on the
  grid and dialogs, portable mode (`s3b-portable` marker file).

### Added — packaging & release

- Release pipeline on `v*` tags: Windows NSIS installer (App Paths entry —
  Win+R `s3b` works without touching PATH), standalone zips/tarballs,
  macOS dmg, `SHA256SUMS`, dependency report and SBOM (SPDX-JSON, syft) per
  release.
- Generated single-file CLI reference (`docs/cli.md`, `go run
  ./tools/gendocs`) with a CI freshness check; competitive comparison and
  security-model pages; `CHANGELOG.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Memory-bound listing test: a hermetic walk of 250k objects through an
  in-process mock S3 grows the live heap by <1 MB (retaining everything
  costs 40 MB) plus a 100k-object listing benchmark — the O(page) streaming
  guarantee (PLAN.md §13) is now pinned by CI.

### Fixed

- **CI was silently building Wails' stub frontend, not the GUI.** The build
  matrix passed tags unquoted (`tags: desktop,production`); YAML flow
  mappings split at the comma, so CI built with `-tags desktop` only. The
  `production` tag is what selects Wails' real desktop frontend — without
  it, `internal/app/app_default_unix.go` compiles a stub that imports no
  GUI code at all, so every platform "built" without cgo, GTK or Cocoa and
  the artifacts were CLI-only binaries with a build-tag error for a GUI.
  Matrix tags are now quoted; CI builds the same binaries the release
  pipeline does.
- **Release pipeline: linux/darwin GUI builds.** Real production builds
  surfaced three platform requirements, now fixed in CI and release
  workflows: linux needs Wails' `webkit2_41` tag on Ubuntu 24.04 (which
  ships webkit2gtk 4.1 only); darwin cross-arch builds (amd64 on arm64
  runners) need `CGO_ENABLED=1` (Go disables cgo when cross-compiling);
  and the macOS 26 SDK needs `-framework UniformTypeIdentifiers` linked
  explicitly (WailsContext.m uses UTType, which the SDK no longer
  auto-links).
- **GUI builds required Wails' build tags all along.** A plain
  `go build` produced a binary whose GUI face only showed Wails' "will not
  build without the correct build tags" error (the CLI face worked, which
  is why e2e never caught it). All documented build commands, CI and
  release pipelines now pass `-tags desktop,production`.
- **GUI: backend bindings were unreachable — the app booted to an empty
  shell.** Wails exposes bound Go methods under `window.go[<full import
  path>].App`, but the frontend assumed a nested `window.go.pkg.api.App`
  path (and `window.go.main.App` for the local pane). The binding is now
  resolved by probing `window.go` once (api.js), so the GUI works on every
  Wails version/layout. Found by live validation against a real bucket.
- **GUI: the details grid never rendered any rows.** The virtualized row
  pool was built and configured but never attached to the DOM (missing
  `canvas.appendChild`), so listings showed an empty body while the status
  bar still counted items. Selection, filtering and keyboard navigation
  worked on the model, which masked the bug in smoke tests.
- Storage-class conversion to the same class is now idempotent (S3
  rejects no-op self-copies; they are treated as success).
- Object-lock buckets must be created with `mb --object-lock`; the CLI
  and GUI create a clear error instead of a raw provider failure.
- Clearing/shortening GOVERNANCE retention sends
  `x-amz-bypass-governance-retention` when `--bypass-governance` is set.

### Known issues

- **Cancelling a native file/folder dialog closes the whole app on
  Windows.** Pressing ESC or "Cancel" in the OS "Choose download folder" /
  upload picker terminates the app: the cancelled Windows file dialog
  posts `WM_QUIT`, and Wails v2's Windows message loop treats it as an
  exit signal. Workaround: pick a folder instead of cancelling, or close
  the dialog with its X button. In-app (HTML) dialogs cancel normally.
